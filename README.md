## About Pizza Test

This is a new E-commerce platform that entails pizza delivery. It has been done in Laravel Framework which takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:


- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).


## The Application is composed of:

- Admin Dashboard
- User/Customer Interface

## Admin Dashboard

I have used admin-lte for the dashboard and implemented it using VueJs Framework. It has the 
following features:

- **Dashboard component**
- **Management module with-: Categories, Products & Users Component**
- **Manage Orders component**
- **Profile component**
- **Logout**

## User/Customer Interface

The ui/ux has been achieved using the normal blade views in laravel with the full process of ordering pizza. 
The is responsive on desktop & mobile as well.

## Admin Credentials
